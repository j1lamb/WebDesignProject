                   <h3>Bio</h3>
                       <p class="description">I grew up in a small town called Walden, NY. It is 1 hour and 45 minutes South of Siena. I love playing and watching basketball during my free time. I attended Valley Central High School where I played on the basketball team for four years. I still play here at Siena; I play pick-up and intramurals at the MAC. My first job was a Pizza Delivery Driver for Guido's Pizza in Walden which I still do from time to time. I like my job because I get to drive my car. I love driving around, listening to music, in the summer time. Each year my family and I take a vacation to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. It is one of our family traditions.</p>

                   <h3>Goals</h3>
                       <p class="description">My professional goal is to get into the Cyber Security field. The topic of Information Security is very interesting to me. My short term goal is to first graduate college with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Criminal Justice. Once I have an established career in the Cyber Security field, I want to travel to different countries. I have not had the opportunity to go abroad yet in my life and I want to see other countries and cultures. I feel that would be a fun experience. I want to go to an English Premier League game and see some of the famous soccer stadiums in Europe.</p>
